## Artifacts Evaluated: Functional badge

We believe SnR satisfies the functional badge.

- Our documentation on how to run the artifact and interpret the results is 
detailed and allows future researchers to validate our claims.
- The data obtained from running `make benchmark` was used to create the
graphs and tables in our paper.
- By changing the values in `benchmark/set_env.bash`, future researchers can
add or remove classes from the knowledge base and run SnR on different
code snippets.
- We documented our LICENSE
- We listed the REQUIREMENTS for running SnR
- We provided a Docker image to ease the installation process.

For these reasons above, we believe our artifact satisfied the Functional badge.
